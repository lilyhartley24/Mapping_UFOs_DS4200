Mapping the Unknown: Temporal and Regional Trends in UFO Reports

It is important to understand the temporal and geographical distribution of UFO sightings because of the cultural and scientific significance that these sightings have. An unidentified flying object (UFO) is an object or optical phenomenon seen in the sky that is not yet identified or explained. After the development of rocketry after World War II, UFOs became a major subject of interest and were believed by some researchers to be evidence of intelligent extraterrestrial life visiting Earth. UFO sightings have become a recurring topic of academic research, media attention, and public discourse. Scholars in fields such as psychology, sociology, and atmospheric science study UFO reports to better understand human perception, memory, and the ways people interpret ambiguous visual stimuli. These sightings are also interesting because they reveal a strong divide between believers, who view them as potential evidence of extraterrestrial life or undisclosed government technology, and skeptics, who often attribute them to natural phenomena, aircraft, or cognitive biases. This divide highlights broader themes about trust in institutions, scientific skepticism, and the human tendency to search for meaning in unexplained events.
